Stream languages offer a simple multi-core programming model and achieve good performance. Yet expressing data rearrangement patterns (like a matrix block decomposition) in these languages is verbose and error prone. In this paper, we propose a high-level programming language to elegantly describe n-dimensional data reorganization patterns. We show how to compile it to stream languages.
