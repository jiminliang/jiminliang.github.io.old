abstract = {This paper proposes an effective scale invariant texture representation based on frequency decomposition and gradient orientation. First, the image intensities are decomposed into different orientations by using wedge filters in the frequency domain, and the N-nary coding method is adopted for the vector quantization. Second, the scale invariant gradient orientation is generated by selecting the most stable value of the gradient orientation with different Gaussian scales. Finally, the 2D joint distribution of the two types of local descriptors is used as the representation. The performance was evaluated on texture classification using a nearest neighbor classifier. Simple but not ordinary, our method achieves state of the art classification performance on the KTH-TIPS dataset under the traditional experimental design. Moreover, the main experiments were conducted on the KTH-TIPS and KTH-TIPS2-b datasets with the experimental designs of scale invariance validation. Compared with the methods of basic image features (BIFs) and local energy pattern (LEP), the proposed representation achieves superior performance with much lower dimension of representation.},

abstract = {Object detection methods based on keypoint localization are widely used, and the rotation invariance is one of the fundamental issues to consider. This paper proposes a novel shape prior model with rotation invariance. The proposed shape prior model discards all orientation-involved features and only uses the distance features among keypoints, hence it is competent to detect objects with a rotation of the arbitrary angle when combined with local appearance description with rotation invariance. In the stage of detection, belief propagation algorithm is employed, so that our method no longer needs the initial position of the keypoints. Furthermore, we generalize the classical distance transforms, the generalized distance transforms make the beliefs to be calculated in a nearly linear time. Experiments were carried out on face category and touring-bike category in the Caltech-256 database. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a strong robustness of rotation.},

abstract = {By recording a time series of tomographic images, dynamic fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) allows exploring perfusion, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics of labeled substances in vivo. Usually, dynamic tomographic images are first reconstructed frame by frame, and then unmixing based on principle component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA) is performed to detect and visualize functional structures with different kinetic patterns. PCA and ICA assume sources are statistically uncorrelated or independent and donot perform well when correlated sources are present. In this paper, we deduce the relationship between the measured imaging data and the kinetic patterns and present a temporal unmixing approach, which is based on nonnegative blind source separation (BSS) method with a convex analysis framework to separate the measured data. The presented method requires no assumption on source independence or zero correlations. Several numerical simulations and phantom experiments are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed temporal unmixing method. The results indicate that it is feasible to unmix the measured data before the tomographic reconstruction and the BSS based method provides better unmixing quality compared with PCA and ICA.},

abstract = {Weak intensity and poor penetration depth are two big obstacles toward clinical use of Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI). In this proof-of-concept study, we overcame these limitations by using lanthanides-based radioluminescent microparticles (RLMPs), called terbium doped Gd2O2S. The characterization experiment showed that the emission excited by Cerenkov luminescence can be neglected whereas the spectrum experiment demonstrated that the RLMPs can actually be excited by gamma-rays. A series of in vitro experiments demonstrated that RLMPs significantly improve the intensity and the penetration capacity of CLI, which has been extended to as deep as 15 mm. In vivo pseudotumor study further prove the huge potential of this enhancement strategy for Cerenkov luminescence imaging in living animal studies.},

abstract = {Aiming at the limitations of the simplified spherical harmonics approximation (SPN) and diffusion equation (DE) in describing the light propagation in tissues, a hybrid simplified spherical harmonics with diffusion equation (HSDE) based diffuse light transport model is proposed. In the HSDE model, the living body is first segmented into several major organs, and then the organs are divided into high scattering tissues and other tissues. DE and SPN are employed to describe the light propagation in these two kinds of tissues respectively, which are finally coupled using the established boundary coupling condition. The HSDE model makes full use of the advantages of SPN and DE, and abandons their disadvantages, so that it can provide a perfect balance between accuracy and computation time. Using the finite element method, the HSDE is solved for light flux density map on body surface. The accuracy and efficiency of the HSDE are validated with both regular geometries and digital mouse model based simulations. Corresponding results reveal that a comparable accuracy and much less computation time are achieved compared with the SPN model as well as a much better accuracy compared with the DE one.},

abstract = {X-ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) has become a promising imaging technology for biological application based on phosphor nanoparticles. There are mainly three kinds of XLCT imaging systems: pencil beam XLCT, narrow beam XLCT and cone beam XLCT. Narrow beam XLCT can be regarded as a balance between the pencil beam mode and the cone-beam mode in terms of imaging efficiency and image quality. The collimated X-ray beams are assumed to be parallel ones in the traditional narrow beam XLCT. However, we observe that the cone beam X-rays are collimated into X-ray beams with fan-shaped broadening instead of parallel ones in our prototype narrow beam XLCT. Hence we incorporate the distribution of the X-ray beams in the physical model and collected the optical data from only two perpendicular directions to further speed up the scanning time. Meanwhile we propose a depth related adaptive regularized split Bregman (DARSB) method in reconstruction. The simulation experiments show that the proposed physical model and method can achieve better results in the location error, dice coefficient, mean square error and the intensity error than the traditional split Bregman method and validate the feasibility of method. The phantom experiment can obtain the location error less than 1.1 mm and validate that the incorporation of fan-shaped X-ray beams in our model can achieve better results than the parallel X-rays.},

With different types of tissues, which were classified by the ratio of , the two equations have their own application scopes. However, the classification criterion was blurring and unreasonable, and the scope has not been systematically investigated until now. In this study, a new criterion for classifying tissues was established based on the absolute value of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients. Using the newly defined classification criterion, the performance and applicability of the SP3 and DA equations were evaluated with a series of investigation experiments. Extensive investigation results showed that the SP3 equation exhibited a better performance and wider applicability than the DA one in most of the observed cases, especially in tissues of low-scattering-low-absorption and low-scattering-high-absorption range. For the case of tissues with the high-scattering-low-absorption properties, a similar performance was observed for both the SP3 and the DA equations, in which case the DA was the preferred option for 3D whole-body optical imaging. Results of this study would provide significant reference for the study of hybrid light transport models.},

abstract = {Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) provides potential to use clinical radiotracers for optical imaging. The goal of this study was to present a newly developed endoscopic CLI (ECLI) system and illustrate its feasibility and potential in distinguishing and quantifying cancerous lesions of the GI tract. The ECLI system was established by integrating an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera with a flexible fibre endoscope. Phantom experiments and animal studies were conducted to test and illustrate the system in detecting and quantifying the presence of radionuclide in vitro and in vivo. A pilot clinical study was performed to evaluate our system in clinical settings. Phantom and mice experiments demonstrated its ability to acquire both the luminescent and photographic images with high accuracy. Linear quantitative relationships were also obtained when comparing the ECLI radiance with the radiotracer activity (r (2) = 0.9779) and traditional CLI values (r (2) = 0.9025). Imaging of patients revealed the potential of ECLI in the identification and quantification of cancerous tissue from normal, which showed good consistence with the clinical PET examination. The new ECLI system shows good consistence with the clinical PET examination and has great potential for clinical translation and in aiding detection of the GI tract disease.},
