  abstract = {Volumetric imaging allows global understanding of three-dimensional (3D) complex systems. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and optical projection tomography have been reported to image 3D volumes with high resolutions and at high speeds. Such methods, however, usually rely on fluorescent labels for chemical targeting, which could perturb the biological functionality in living systems. We demonstrate Bessel-beam-based stimulated Raman projection (SRP) microscopy and tomography for label-free volumetric chemical imaging. Our SRP microscope enables fast quantitation of chemicals in a 3D volume through a two-dimensional lateral scan. Furthermore, combining SRP and sample rotation, we demonstrate the SRP tomography that can reconstruct the 3D distribution of chemical compositions with optical spatial resolution at a higher speed than the Gaussian-beam-based stimulated Raman scattering sectioning imaging can. We explore the potential of our SRP technology by mapping polymer particles in 3D volumes and lipid droplets in adipose cells.},

  abstract = {Most previous studies exploring the neural mechanism of psychogenic erectile dysfunction (pED) focused on brain activity under tasks. We suggest that the resting brain activity is equally important in pED studies, in that the patterns of spontaneous neural activities is independent of modalities of sensory input, therefore providing substantial information regarding the central mechanism of pED. Our previous study reported the altered baseline activity in right anterior insula (aINS) in pED patients. Also, the insula is a pivotal region in sexual behavior, which is suggested to be able to directly mediate erection. Therefore, the current study employed resting-state fMRI to examine alterations in functional connectivity of the aINS comparing pED patients with matched control subjects. After rigorous participant inclusion procedure, 27 pED patients and 27 healthy male controls were enrolled. Our results elucidated the disrupted homogeneity within the right aINS and aberrant connection patterns between the right aINS and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), as well as the right aINS and the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) respectively in pED group, as compared with the healthy controls. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the aberrant insula-centered functional connectivity in pED, which may be related to the abnormal representation of internal bodily state or needs in pED patients and thus further affect the inhibitory control in the sexual context. We hope that these findings may shed new light on the understanding of the central mechanism of pED.},

  abstract = {For a rotatory dual-head positron emission tomography (PET) system, how to determine the rotation increments is an open problem. In this study, we simulated the characteristics of a rotatory dual-head PET system. The influences of different rotation increments were compared and analyzed. Based on this simulation, the imaging performance of a prototype system was verified. A reconstruction flowchart was proposed based on a precalculated system response matrix (SRM). The SRM made the relationships between the voxels and lines of response (LORs) fixed; therefore, we added the interpolation method into the flowchart. Five metrics, including spatial resolution, normalized mean squared error (NMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), contrast-to-noise (CNR), and structure similarity (SSIM), were applied to assess the reconstructed image quality. The results indicated that the 60 degree rotation increments with the bilinear interpolation had advantages in resolution, PSNR, NMSE, and SSIM. In terms of CNR, the 90 degree rotation increments were better than other increments. In addition, the reconstructed images of 90 degree rotation increments were also flatter than that of 60 degree increments. Therefore, both the 60 and 90 degree rotation increments could be used in the real experiments, and which one to choose may depend on the application requirement.},

  abstract = {The combination of different modality images can provide detailed and comprehensive information for the prognostic assessment and therapeutic strategy of patients with ischemic heart disease. In this study, a 3D fusion framework is designed to integrate coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA), 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]DG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, and [(68)Ga]-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid-(Arg-Gly-Asp)2 ([(68)Ga]-NOTA-PRGD2) PET/CT images of the myocardial infarction model in minipigs. First, the structural anatomy of the heart in coronary CTA and CT is segmented using a multi-atlas-based method. Then, the hearts are registered using the B-spline-based free form deformation. Finally, the [(18)F]DG and [(68)Ga]-NOTA-PRGD2 signals are mapped into the heart in coronary CTA, which produces a single fusion image to delineate both the cardiac structural anatomy and the functional information of myocardial viability and angiogenesis. Heart segmentation demonstrates high accuracy with good agreement between manual delineation and automatic segmentation. The fusion result intuitively reflects the extent of the [(18)F]DG uptake defect as well as the location where the [(68)Ga]-NOTA-PRGD2 signal appears. The fusion result verified the occurrence of angiogenesis based on the in vivo noninvasive molecular imaging approach. The presented framework is helpful in facilitating the study of the relationship between infarct territories and blocked coronary arteries as well as angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {The Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) has built a bridge between the nuclear and optical imaging, and opened a new direction of optical imaging in clinic translation. However, the wide applications of CLI are limited by the weak intensity and poor penetration capacity. By coupling highly sensitive charged coupled device camera with optical fiber bundle based endoscope, Cerenkov luminescence endoscopy (CLE) has recently been developed to overcome these limitations. Using the CLE, diseases deep buried in the body, such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancer, can be identified by radiotracer, which can hardly be detected by CLI from the surface of the body. Here, we review recent progress on CLI and CLE, including the principle, imaging instrument, as well as applications. In addition, the intensity enhanced strategies for Cerenkov luminescence are presented, which may provide an ideal solution to the obstacle of CLE in the translation studies. In the end, we present possible future directions of the CLE technology.},

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis of myocardial infarction is important for the prognostic assessment and therapeutic strategy of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is generally regarded as the gold standard for in vivo assessing myocardial viability. However, currently PET scans can only be interpreted by well trained radiologists because the morphological variation and location of infarct myocardium is hard to reflect visually on 2D slices or polar plot. In this paper, a 3D non-rigid coronary CTA (CCTA)-PET registration strategy is presented to quantitative analysis the extent of myocardial infarction. Whole heart is firstly segmented from both CCTA and PET/CT. Then the myocardium of left ventricle (LV) is separated from CCTA and PET/CT, respectively. After morphological post-processing, the myocardium image is integrated with the whole heart image both for CCTA and PET/CT to conduct the myocardial registration. A random forest classifier is trained to identify the infarct area of LV wall. The myocardial infarction analysis method proposed in this paper is compared with the cardiac tissue histological study. The result demonstrates good agreement with the TTC stain result in both infarct size and location, and suggests a potential value for clinic application in the prognosis of myocardial infarction.},
